use strict;

#'use strict' turns on strict pragma which will make you declare your variables with ‘my’ keyword. This will help you write better and cleaner code.


my $string="This is a kind of dynamic array";
my @array;
@array=split('a',$string);
foreach(@array)
{
    print "$_ \n";     # This is a special variable which stores the current value.
}
