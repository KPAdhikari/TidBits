# Perl has a mechanism using which we can generate reports. Using this feature, we can make reports exactly the way we want while printing on the Output screen or in a file. A simple format can be written using printf or sprintf functions available in Perl.
#             printf "%05d\n", 30;
# This will include leading zeros in front of number 30 making a total count of digits to 5. The same can be used for sprintf.
#             sprintf "%05d\n", 30; # This will print the same as printf.
#Using printf and sprintf, we can obtain most of the Perl formats. In the case of reports, it will be difficult to implement.
