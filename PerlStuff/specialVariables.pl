#Special variables in Perl are those which have some predefined meaning. These variables are denoted with either real Name or Punctuation symbols. We have a special variable for all the Perl supported Variables like scalar special variables, Array special variables, hash special variables. Most of the special variables that we use are of scalars.

#When we want to use the special variable with its name, then we have to load a Perl module 'use English,' to explicitly say Perl interpreter that we are going to use special variables using its Name.

print " \$.: $.\n"; # Holds the current line number of the file that is being read
print " \$#: $#\n"; #This variable is used for output format while printing numbers.
